# Basic.
A stack is an abstract data type that supports four basic operations, push, pop, peek and empty. Elements are added and removed from the stack following the LIFO (Last In First Out) policy.
Elements are added (pushed) on top of the stack and they are removed (popped) from the top of the stack. If the stack is empty, pop operation typically returns null or throws an exception.
 
- push(element) : add an element on top of the stack
- pop() : remove the element on top of the stack and return null or throw an exefption if the stack is empty
- peek() : return the element on top of the stack and return null or throws an exception if the stack is empty
- isEmpty() : return true if the stack is empty and false otherwise.
